        <span style="font-weight: bold">What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</span>
        <br>
        HTML, URLs, HTTP, Chrome, and Firefox were key factors in the
        World Wide Web's success.
        <br>
        HTML helped structure webpages, URLs provided web addresses,
        <br>
        HTTP allowed data transfer, and web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox
        played important roles.
        <br> <br>

        <span style=" font-weight: bold"> How are resources (html pages, images, etc.)  addressed in the web?</span>
        <br>
        Resources such as HTML pages, images, and other elements
        are addressed on the web using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
        <br>
        <br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold">What are the general components of an url?</span>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Scheme: The scheme indicates the protocol being used to access the resource, like "http", "https", "mailto", etc. </li>
            <li>Host: The host specifies the domain or IP address of the server where the resource is located, like "www.amazon.com" or "www.youtube.com"</li>
            <li>Path: The path identifies the specific location or file on the server's directory structure, like /assets/picture/product03.png</li>
            <li>Query: The query component is used to pass parameters or data to the resource. Most of the time a "?" is used</li>
            <li>Fragment: The fragment, also known as the anchor, is used to identify a specific section within a webpage, like "#history"</li>
        </ol>

        <span style="font-weight: bold">What is a web server?</span>
        <br>
        A web server is a program that delivers web pages, images, assets, etc. from the internet to the web client. It is like a waiter, where the kitchen is the Internet and the customer is the Client.
